## Experiments

All experiments were executed using the unified experimental pipeline implemented in `src/experiments.py`.  
The following optimisation algorithms were evaluated:

- Hill Climbing
- Tabu Search
- Genetic Algorithm

Each algorithm was tested on Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances of size **10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cities**, with **30 independent runs per configuration** to ensure statistical reliability. Identical city subsets and fixed random seeds were used across all algorithms to guarantee fair comparison and full reproducibility.

### Performance Metrics
The following performance metrics were recorded automatically for each configuration:

- Mean tour length  
- Standard deviation of tour length  
- Mean runtime  
- Standard deviation of runtime  

All results were exported automatically as CSV files to:

### Running the Experiments

To reproduce all experimental results, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m src.experiments
